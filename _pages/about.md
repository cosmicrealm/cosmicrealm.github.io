I am an **AI Engineer** working on multi-modal learning and digital human generation, with a focus on speech-driven facial generation, digital human synthesis, and AIGC generation & understanding. I have strong experience in Diffusion Models, Flow Matching , DiT, VQ-VAE/GAN, ControlNet, LoRA, IP-Adapter, Stable Diffusion, FLUX and so on.

Previously, I worked at Xiaobing, where I developed digital human and talking-face generation systems, also contributed to real-time avatar rendering.

I also worked as an **Algorithm Engineer** at Orbbec and Moqi, companies focusing on 3D sensing and biometrics.

I received my Master’s degree from the School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU), Xi’an, China, under the supervision of [Prof. WeiWei](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/weiwei.html) and    [Prof. ZhangLei](https://sites.google.com/site/leizhanghyperspectral/home).

I received my Bachelor’s degree in the school of computer science, NorthWestern Polytechnical University(NWPU), Xi'an, China.

<!-- Research
======
My research interests mainly lie in machine learning, especially in deep learning and computer vision.


My work has focused on hyperspectral image processing, particularly in addressing insufficient or missing labels using semi-supervised and few-shot learning approaches.

Currently, I am working in the biometric domain, addressing large-scale matching tasks on GPUs. -->
